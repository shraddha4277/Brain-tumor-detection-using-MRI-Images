# Brain-tumor-detection-using-MRI-Images
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained on a dataset consisting of both tumor and healthy MRI images to classify whether a given scan contains a tumor or not.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of two classes:
Positive Class: MRI scans containing brain tumors.
Negative Class: Healthy brain MRI scans without tumors.
The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and evaluation sets for model training and validation.

Project Structure:
Data Preparation: Images are read, resized, and preprocessed using OpenCV for compatibility with the CNN model.
Model Definition: A CNN model architecture is defined using PyTorch, consisting of convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.
Training: The model is trained using Adam optimizer with Binary Cross Entropy Loss. Training progress is monitored for loss convergence and accuracy metrics.
Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate validation set using accuracy and other metrics to assess its performance.
Visualization: Outputs and performance metrics are visualized using Matplotlib to understand model predictions and validate results.

Data Preparation:
Organize your MRI dataset into positive and negative folders for tumor and healthy scans, respectively.
Update file paths (path) in the MRI class to point to your dataset location.

Training:
Instantiate the MRI dataset class and normalize the images.
Define and train the CNN model using the provided training script. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs) as necessary.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on a validation set using the evaluation script.
Visualize model outputs and metrics to interpret performance.

Deployment:
Save the trained model for deployment in clinical or research settings.
Ensure regulatory compliance and validation against clinical standards before deployment.

Future Improvements:
Incorporate data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
Explore transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models for improved performance.
Implement an interactive web interface or API for real-time tumor detection.
