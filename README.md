# Brain-tumor-detection-using-MRI-Images

Description of the dataset

I'm working on a project where I'll be using MRI scans to detect brain tumors. I've gathered a dataset of MRI images that are already labeled as healthy or containing a tumor. I'm sharing this dataset with the community in case anyone wants to use it for their own research or projects.
