These dependencies ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries to run effectively:
Python 3.x - Python is the programming language used for implementing the project.

PyTorch - PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that provides tensors and dynamic neural networks in Python.
Installation: pip install torch torchvision

OpenCV - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for image processing tasks, such as reading and resizing MRI images.
Installation: pip install opencv-python

Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python used to visualize model outputs, performance metrics, and other data.
Installation: pip install matplotlib

Other Libraries:

scikit-learn - scikit-learn provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, useful for metrics and model evaluation.
Installation: pip install scikit-learn
TensorFlow - TensorFlow is another deep learning framework that could be used alongside or instead of PyTorch, depending on project requirements.
Installation: pip install tensorflow

CUDA (Optional, for GPU acceleration)
If you have NVIDIA GPUs and want to accelerate computations, install CUDA and cuDNN.
